# Stepper-Motor


The aim of this project is to implement a digital system using FPGA based on FSM  and standard combinational modules to drive the 55SI-25 DAWC stepper motor which is a digital electromechanical motor which works on the digital input pulses.We aim to interface this module inorder to control the speed and directon of the stepper motor using different speed inputs from the DE2 board with a direction input.

# Getting started :

Inorder to use this design : 

1- Open the project in Quartus II 

2- Open and implement the global design block-Diagram-File (BDF) and perform simulations to verify the system functionality.

3- Re-assign the pins with four GPIO pins to be connected to the stepper motor through a 74244 tri.state buffer and a ULN2803 driver.

4-Verify the different step mottor speed and direction using the DE2 board.
